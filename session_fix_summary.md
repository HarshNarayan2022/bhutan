Session Fix Summary for Login/Dashboard Redirect Loop
===================================================

PROBLEM:
- User signs up → redirects to user_dashboard
- @login_required checks session → redirects back to login  
- Infinite redirect loop ♻️

ROOT CAUSE:
- Session data not persisting properly between signup and redirect
- Timing issue where session wasn't saved before redirect
- Flask session configuration inconsistencies

SOLUTION APPLIED:
1. **Improved Session Configuration:**
   - Set SESSION_PERMANENT = True (was False)
   - Added SESSION_USE_SIGNER for extra security
   - Consistent session lifetime settings

2. **Enhanced Signup Session Handling:**
   - Clear existing session data before setting new data
   - Commit database changes BEFORE setting session
   - Add small delay (0.1s) to ensure session persistence
   - Force session.permanent = True and session.modified = True

3. **Enhanced Login Session Handling:**
   - Ensure session.modified = True after setting session data
   - Consistent session handling between login and signup

4. **Improved Login Required Debugging:**
   - Added detailed logging to see exactly what's in session
   - Better error messages for troubleshooting

EXPECTED FLOW AFTER FIX:
1. User signs up → session properly saved with user_id
2. Redirect to user_dashboard → @login_required finds valid user_id
3. Dashboard loads successfully ✅
4. User can access assessment (also @login_required protected)

KEY CHANGES:
- main.py line ~47: SESSION_PERMANENT = True
- main.py line ~638: Enhanced signup session handling
- main.py line ~557: Ensured login session.modified = True  
- main.py line ~438: Enhanced login_required debugging

This keeps the security (@login_required) while fixing the session persistence issue.
