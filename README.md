## üöÄ Hugging Face Spaces Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio.

### Prerequisites
- Hugging Face account
- Git
- Required API keys (Google, OpenAI, Groq)

### Environment Variables

Set the following secrets in your Hugging Face Space:

#### Required API Keys
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

#### Security
```env
SECRET_KEY=your_super_secure_secret_key
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key
```

#### Optional Configuration
```env
FLASK_ENV=production
DEBUG=false
HUGGINGFACE_SPACES=1
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Create a New Space**
   - Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
   - Click "Create new Space"
   - Choose **Gradio** as the SDK
   - Select **Python** as the programming language

2. **Upload Your Code**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository>
   cd bhutan
   
   # Initialize git for Spaces
   git init
   git remote add origin https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME
   
   # Add and commit files
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial deployment to Hugging Face Spaces"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Configure Space Settings**
   - **Hardware**: Choose CPU Basic (free) or upgrade for better performance
   - **Visibility**: Public or Private as preferred
   - **Secrets**: Add all required environment variables in the Settings tab

4. **Set Up Dependencies**
   The `requirements.txt` file is already configured for Spaces deployment with:
   - Gradio for the interface
   - Flask for backend logic
   - AI/ML libraries (optimized versions)
   - All necessary dependencies

5. **Entry Point**
   The application uses `app.py` as the main entry point, which:
   - Creates a Gradio Blocks interface
   - Integrates all Flask backend functionality
   - Provides tabs for Chat, Voice, Assessment, Resources, and About
   - Handles session management and user interactions

### Space Configuration

#### Hardware Requirements
- **CPU Basic**: Suitable for basic chat functionality
- **CPU Upgrade**: Recommended for full AI features including voice processing
- **GPU**: Not required but can improve response times

#### File Structure for Spaces
```
